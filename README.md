# Steam Cross-Platform Wishlist

Chrome extension that adds Switch/PlayStation/Xbox/Steam Deck availability icons to your Steam wishlist. Uses Wikidata for console platforms and Steam's own data for Steam Deck.

## What it does

You're browsing your Steam wishlist wondering "can I play this on my Switch?" - this extension shows you at a glance. Three little icons appear next to each game showing whether it's on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, or Xbox.

Click an icon to go directly to that platform's store page.

## How it works

1. Extracts game info from your Steam wishlist page
2. Queries Wikidata's SPARQL API for platform availability
3. Caches results locally (7 days) so it's fast on repeat visits
4. Injects icons next to each game

The Wikidata lookup happens in the background. There's a 500ms delay between requests to be nice to their servers.

## Icon states

**Console platforms (Switch/PlayStation/Xbox):**
- **Bright icon** = available, click to open store

**Steam Deck:**
- **Bright icon** = Verified (works great on Steam Deck)
- **Dimmed icon** = Playable (may need tweaks)

## Privacy

**Host permissions required:**
- `store.steampowered.com` - to inject icons on your wishlist page
- `query.wikidata.org` - to fetch platform availability data

**Data handling:**
- Makes external API requests to Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint for platform lookups
- All cached data stays in chrome.storage.local (never sent anywhere)
- No analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- Store links are region-agnostic (auto-redirects to your local store)
