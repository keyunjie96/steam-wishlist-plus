## Feature Enhancements

### FEAT-9: ChromeOS support via ProtonDB
**Priority:** P3 (Low Value)
**Files:** New `src/protondbClient.js`, `src/content.js`, `src/icons.js`
**Issue:** No visibility into Linux/ChromeOS/SteamOS compatibility for users on those platforms.
**Data source:** ProtonDB API: `https://www.protondb.com/api/v1/reports/summaries/<appid>.json`
**Fix:**
1. Create `src/protondbClient.js` to fetch ProtonDB ratings
2. Add ChromeOS icon to icons.js with tier-based styling (White:Playable/Hidden:Others)
3. Show icon in content.js based on ProtonDB tier
4. Consider caching with appropriate TTL
**Risk:** Medium - ProtonDB API is unofficial but stable. Tier colors may conflict with existing dimmed/available styling.

### FEAT-8: Firefox/Edge browser support
**Priority:** P3 (Lower Priority)
**Files:** New `manifest-firefox.json`, build scripts, `src/background.js`
**Issue:** Extension only works on Chrome. Firefox and Edge users excluded.
**Fix:**
1. Create Firefox-compatible manifest (MV2, `background.scripts` instead of `service_worker`)
2. Add Edge-specific manifest settings
3. Create build script to generate browser-specific packages
4. Test on all 3 browsers
**Risk:** Medium - Firefox uses WebExtensions (MV2-like), requires different manifest. Service workers may need polyfill. 3× testing effort. Different store approval processes.

## Declined Features

Features below were evaluated and declined because established extensions (Augmented Steam, SteamDB, ProtonDB for Steam) already implement them well, or the technical risk was too high. This extension focuses on **useful wishlist signals** (platform availability, review scores, completion times) that Steam doesn't provide natively.

| Feature | Reason | Incumbent |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Wishlist export (CSV/JSON) | Not core to console availability | Augmented Steam |
| Wishlist categories/folders | Very high risk: React state inaccessible | - |
| True Discount indicator | Commoditized | SteamDB, Augmented Steam |
| GOG/Epic platforms | Out of scope: PC storefronts, not consoles | - |
| Library detection | Very high risk: API limitations | - |
| Game notes | Commoditized | Augmented Steam, Steam native |
| Historical low price | Redundant with True Discount | SteamDB, Augmented Steam |

## Ideas to Explore

### IDEA-1: Price threshold alerts
**Concept:** Notify user when game hits user-defined price (e.g., "Tell me when Elden Ring is under $30").
**Challenge:** Steam sales are frequent - would generate many notifications. Need smart filtering.
**Approach:** Use `chrome.alarms` API for periodic checks, `chrome.notifications` for alerts.
**Risk:** High user annoyance if too many notifications. Needs careful UX design.

### IDEA-2: Smart removal suggestions
**Concept:** Surface games user might want to remove from wishlist (e.g., games wishlisted 3+ years ago, games with poor reviews).
**Challenge:** Hard to get signal right - what makes a game "removable"?
**Approach:** Analyze wishlist age, review scores, last price drop. Show subtle indicator.
**Risk:** Users may feel patronized. Need opt-in and non-intrusive UI.

---

## Technical Debt

### DEBT-2: Bundle/minify for production
**Files:** Build scripts, `manifest.json`
**Issue:** Currently loads compiled JS files from `dist/`. Production build could reduce extension size.
**Fix:** Add webpack/esbuild bundler, minify output.
**Risk:** Low - standard build tooling. Source maps needed for debugging.

- [x] DOC-1: README privacy section corrected for Chrome Web Store disclosure
- [x] BUG-2: Keep icons in unknown state on failure instead of blanking

- [x] REL-1: Misleading initialization log (now says "Started processing items")
- [x] BUG-3: Icons disappear when wishlist filter is applied (fixed: dual-strategy item detection)
- [x] UX-1: Refine icon loading state (fixed: single loader, dynamic icon injection)
- [x] LIFECYCLE-1: Icon lifecycle management (fixed: cleanupAllIcons on URL change, stale container validation, strengthened duplicate prevention)
- [x] FEAT-2: User preferences for platform visibility (added toggles for Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, Steam Deck in options)
- [x] FEAT-5: HLTB integration (How Long To Beat) - displays completion time estimates as a badge in the icon row
- [x] MISSING-1: Extension icons for Chrome Web Store (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 PNG icons created)
- [x] MISSING-2: Popup UI (quick-access popup with cache stats and platform toggles)
- [x] UX-2: Fix icon blinking on URL change (replaced cleanupAllIcons with lightCleanup to preserve icons in DOM during React SPA navigation)
- [x] REBRAND-1: Rename from "Steam Cross-Platform Wishlist" to "Steam Wishlist Plus" (name, log prefix SCPW→SWP, globalThis namespace, messaging, docs, marketing, all 50 files updated)
- [x] FEAT-10: Review scores (OpenCritic integration via Wikidata ID lookup)
- [x] FEAT-11: Export cached entries (JSON export from options page)
- [x] BUG-5: OpenCritic API authentication (resolved as part of FEAT-10 via Wikidata ID direct lookup)
